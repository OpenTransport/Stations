## Why this project?

### Problem

Identifying stuff in the transport field is a mess. In every certain field there are different identification methods and they are difficult to interconnect.

For example, when one dataset from a bus company is opened, it takes a lot of fiddling to make the right connections with a train company's dataset. Similar problems exist when programming things cross border (in different countries, the same stops/stations/things have different identifications) or even in the same datasets, to tell which stop is connected to another stop (sometimes they have the same name, in other cases they are a bit different (e.g. an extra id concatenated to the name)). 

### Proposed solution

Using the vocabulary we have discussed at [opentransport/transit-vocab](http://github.com/opentransport/transit-vocab) we will set up a site which can reuse data from various sources and link them all together.

## What should it look like?

... work in progress


## Use cases to keep in minds (add yours)

* An autocomplete list generator for end-user applications
* Intermodal route planning software can use this website to know which stops can be used as transfers to other systems
* ...
